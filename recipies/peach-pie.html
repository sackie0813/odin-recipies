    <h4> Description</h4>
    <p> Pie Made of Peach ??</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds fresh freestone peaches, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 14.1 ounce package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 + 1/2 tablespoons butter, cut into tiny pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Directions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F or 175 degrees C</li>
        <li>Stir together peaches, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl until combined; let sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Strain accumulated juices into a saucepan and return strained peaches to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Bring juices in the saucepan to a boil; reduce heat to medium-high and cook until mixture thickens to a syrup, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Stir lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon into peaches; sprinkle with flour mixture and toss to coat. Pour hot peach syrup over peach mixture and stir.</li>
        <li>Roll out one pastry into a 12-inch circle. Press into the bottom of a 10-inch pie plate. Pour peach filling into crust, tap the pie plate against a flat surface to settle filling, and dot with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll remaining pastry into an 11-inch circle and cut into 1-inch strips using a paring knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Lay 5 pastry dough strips evenly over the top of pie. Weave remaining pastry dough strips through to form a lattice top. Fold the ends of lattice strips under bottom crust and crimp crust to seal. Brush cream over the top and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is bubbly, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool completely before slicing.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
